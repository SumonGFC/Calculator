# Calculator
A simple calculator web app.
This was a first attempt at writing a parser -- one that can evaluate
arbitrary mathematical expressions that contain addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation and parentheses. Please forgive the
mess that is main.js.
This project is part of the "The Odin Project" curriculum. At the point in the
curriculum at which we are given this project, JS modules have not been covered
yet. So I copy and pasted the Lexer, Parser, and Evaluator all into main.js.
See translator/ for independent modules.

Certainly, I will be redoing this project in the future, hopefully when I am
much more competent and with more features.
